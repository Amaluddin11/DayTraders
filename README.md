## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, I was originally interestested in identifying the best technical indicators to predict stock price movement, either up or down using pre-calculated technical indicator based on historical stock data. In the attempts to achieve this, I have realized that the accuracy obtained is not as high as I had hoped for. Therefore, this project then aims to

1. Compare the accuracy of prediction using SVW, SVM with PCA and Neural Networks.
2. What are the most weighted indicators in the top PCA components?
3. Based on this data, can we visualize the data to see if we can really separate the two classes, price up or down?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).
